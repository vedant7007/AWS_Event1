## 🔑 Important

### MongoDB Atlas Already Configured
Connection in `backend/.env`:
```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://jaswanthre9_db_user:csdAaOanTVzVo5Jx@cluster0.9a0oale.mongodb.net/cloud-tycoon?retryWrites=true&w=majority
```

### JWT Secret
See `JWT_AND_AUTHENTICATION.md` for complete explanation.

Current (development):
```
cloud-tycoon-aws-learning-game-2026-super-secret-key-please-change-in-production-use-32-char-string
```

For production, generate new one:
```bash
openssl rand -hex 32
```

REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

### 6. Start Both Servers

**Terminal 1 - Backend:**
```bash
cd backend
npm run dev
# Should see: "✓ Connected to MongoDB" and "🚀 Backend running on port 5000"
```

**Terminal 2 - Frontend:**
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
# Browser opens to http://localhost:3000
```

### 7. Test the Flow

1. Go to http://localhost:3000
2. Click "Register Your Team"
3. Fill in sample data:
   - Team Name: "TestTeam"
   - Members: Alice (CTO), Bob (CFO), Charlie (PM)
   - Passwords: any 4+ chars
4. Copy the Team ID
5. Go to Login page
6. Log in with Team ID, name, and password
7. Complete training and start Year 1 questions

## What to Do Next

### Immediate (Next 1-2 hours)
- [ ] Get backend running locally (`npm run dev` in backend folder)
- [ ] Get frontend running locally (`npm start` in frontend folder)
- [ ] Test registration and login flow
- [ ] Verify Year 1 questions load and submit works

### Short Term (Next 1-2 days)
- [ ] Add Year 2 questions to `backend/src/utils/seedData.js` (18 questions)
- [ ] Add Year 3 questions to `backend/src/utils/seedData.js` (18 questions)
- [ ] Create cascade rules (Year 1→2 and Year 2→3 transformations)
- [ ] Create market events for each year
- [ ] Set up MongoDB Atlas (or local MongoDB)
- [ ] Deploy to production

### Medium Term (Before Event)
- [ ] Test with 10 real students - get feedback on questions
- [ ] Fix any bugs found during testing
- [ ] Train proctors on admin dashboard
- [ ] Do final load testing (60+ users)
- [ ] Set up backup/recovery procedure

---

## Key Concepts

### Cascade Logic
Year 1 decisions directly impact Year 2 starting company state. Example:
- If you downsize EC2 → Year 2 costs lower
- If you set up monitoring → Year 2 you catch problems earlier
- If you commit to 3-year RIs → Year 3 you're locked in

### Market Events
Random/predetermined events that affect teams based on preparedness:
- Year 1: Cost Shock Alert (teams with monitoring get small penalty, others get big penalty)
- Year 2: Customer cancellation (flexible teams recover faster)
- Year 3: Viral surge (prepared teams handle it, others crash)

### Scoring
Each role (CTO, CFO, PM) answers 6-8 questions per year. Questions are scored individually, then averaged per role per year.

**Final Score** = Cumulative profit across all 3 years. Leaderboard ranks by profit.

---

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Can register a team (all 3 members)
- [ ] Can login as each role
- [ ] Can complete Year 1 questions (8 min timer, lockdown mode works)
- [ ] Submitting shows year-end report with cascade effects
- [ ] Can advance to Year 2 and Year 3
- [ ] Final results page shows cumulative profit
- [ ] Leaderboard shows all completed teams
- [ ] Admin dashboard shows live progress
- [ ] Copy-paste is blocked during questions
- [ ] Tab switching is detected and warned
- [ ] DevTools (F12) is blocked

## FAQ

**Q: Where's the admin password?**  
A: For now, anyone can access `/admin`. Add proper admin auth before production.

**Q: Can I change the 3 years to something else?**  
A: You could, but the design is built for 3. Better to keep it.

**Q: How do I add more questions?**  
A: Edit `backend/src/utils/seedData.js` and run `npm run seed`

**Q: What if the server crashes during the event?**  
A: Create a recovery plan (backup, manual scoring). See Phase 7 in IMPLEMENTATION_CHECKLIST.md

**Q: Can students retake a year?**  
A: Currently no. They advance automatically. Could add retry logic if needed.
